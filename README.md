# Frever Scene Asset Pack

Frever is a mobile avatar and content creation platform designed for expressive storytelling through custom 3D characters. Users could create avatars, style outfits, generate short-form video content, and engage in social interactions including chat and user feeds. Videos created with Frever were shared externally and accumulated over **10+ billion views** across platforms.

This open source release contains a Unity project structured for creating and managing **scenes and environments** intended for use within systems like the **Frever App**.

The project includes a sample Unity scene with an environment, lighting, and camera setup. It also contains various assets such as **.fbx models, shaders, and textures** to build or extend these scenes. Additionally, it includes thumbnails and configurations for preparing and uploading scenes to an asset management system.

These assets are primarily used to establish diverse environments, set moods, and provide backdrops for character-driven content and storytelling.

## Instructions for Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    ```
2.  **Open in Unity Hub:** Open the cloned project folder with a compatible Unity Editor version (e.g., Unity 2022.3.x recommended due to URP 14.x dependencies).
3.  **Resolve Packages:** Unity should attempt to resolve the packages listed in `Packages/manifest.json`.
    Manually install packages if needed (though these are expected to be resolved from the manifest).
    Check for any console errors related to package resolution.
4.  **Explore the Scene:**
    Open the sample scene(s) located in the `Assets/Scenes` (or equivalent) folder.
5.  **Create New Scenes:**
    Use the provided assets (`.fbx` models, materials, shaders, textures) to create new environments.
    Follow the existing scene setup (lighting, post-processing, camera configuration) as a template.
6.  **Prepare for Asset Manager:** Utilize the provided scripts and setup for packaging scenes and generating thumbnails if you intend to integrate with a similar asset management system.
